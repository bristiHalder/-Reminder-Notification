# Remainder Notification using Python
This project contains two Python scripts: remainder.py and notification_reminder.py. 

## Description

### Remainder Calculation (remainder.py)

The remainder.py script is a simple Python program that allows users to set remainders. Users can personalize the remainders by adding new calculations and viewing previous remainders. It  uses the plyer module to display desktop notifications at regular intervals.

### Notification Reminder (rest.py)

The rest.py script also uses the plyer module to display desktop notifications at regular intervals. This script is specifically written for a single reminder, with a fixed message and title, this cannot be customized; the message and title are hardcoded.
